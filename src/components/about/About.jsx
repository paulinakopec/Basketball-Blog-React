            Hi! My name is Paulina and I am the author of this blog, which was created due to my long-time love to basketball. 
            I am a basketball player recently playing in DPD in an amateur basketball league called "Koszykarska Liga Biznesu" in Warsaw
            and streetball on indoor and outdoor courts.
            In the past, I was part of AZS SGH Basketball Team, Chicago Bulls Team in Ladies League, AKS ZÅ‚y and La Basket Warsaw.
